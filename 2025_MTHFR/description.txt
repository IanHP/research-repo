Common_pose: allows determination of common poses, then analysis of present interactions (comes from discovery studio output)
Create_MD: the general files requires to run NAMD simulation, and scripts to help setup pdb/psf
DDG_function: creates graphs of rolling average impact of a residues mutation on function (from map) and structure (from DDG)
HBond_analysis: allows finding all H-bond across trajectories
ligand_pocket_distance: allows finding distance between pocket and ligand
MD_analysis_prep: scripts that help with setting up MD outputs for analysis
Prodigy: allows running of prodigy-lig and analysis, which predicts deltaG of ligand-protein interaction

distance_hbond: allows finding distance between two atoms and strength of H-bonds
rmsx: allows finding RMSD and RMSF of trajectory
